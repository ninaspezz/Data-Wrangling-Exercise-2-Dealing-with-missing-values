#in the age column. Why would you pick any of those over the mean# 
#(or not)?#

#Could have calculated mean of sub-sets of passengers, such as surived
#or class and filled in missing values of each within respective class.#

#3: Lifeboat: there are a lot of missing values in the boat column. Fill# 
#these empty slots with a dummy value e.g. the string 'None' or 'NA'#

#This was done in above command: na_if(df, '')#

#4: many passengers donâ€™t have a cabin number associated with them.#
#Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?#
#I think it makes sense to replace blank values with "NA", which was#
#done in above step.#

#What does a missing value here mean?#
#Possible it means just that, a missing cabin number. Upon manually#
#inspecting data, it does not appear that the presense or absense of#
#a cabin number in this data set correlates to survival.#

#Create a new column has_cabin_number which has 1 if there is# 
#a cabin number, and 0 otherwise.#
